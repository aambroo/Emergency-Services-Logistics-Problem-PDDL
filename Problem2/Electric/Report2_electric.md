#TODO: controllare livello batteria quando il robot effettua doppio *load/deliver*

# Problem2_battery
This is an alternative version of Problem2, this time involving battery.
The formulation is equivalent with respect to Problem2, a part from the fact that actions *move*, *load*, and *unload* contribute to battery discharging.
Problem 2 is formulated avoiding `fluents`, a type which is seldom supported by planners.
