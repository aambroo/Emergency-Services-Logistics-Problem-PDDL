# Problem Statement
This assignment can be devided in to main courses of action.
First of all we will **model planning problems** and **build** a state-of-the-art planner using the `PDDL` language provided by the `planutils` framework.
Secondly, we will see how the model can be integrated within a **robotic scenario** by exploiting the powerful `PlanSys2` infrastructure, as shown in this [reposotory](https://github.com/IntelligentRoboticsLabs/ros2_planning_system).


# Setting
The **planning model** is built for solving a logistic problem inspired by emergency services.
In such a scenario, some people are at known locations and need a certain amount of **crates** (might such crates contain _food, medicines_, etc).

Some **assumptions** will be necessary to allow for an efficient generalization.
